                I've published a guide to running a library chess tournament on

                to know.

                I've run a succesful chess program since 2017. At the time,
                I couldn't find any satisfactory guides to give to
                participants. This is one that I wrote myself which aims to
                cover all of the necessary knowledge without being too long
                or too short.
