                    While working at a public library for the last few years,
                    I've developed an all-ages chess program. These are a few

                I've published a guide to running a library chess tournament on
                {" "}<em>Programming Librarian</em>. It covers all of the basic
                knowledge such as scorekeeping and pairing, plus other tips that
                a library worker (or anyone directing a tournamnet) would need
                to know.

                I've run a succesful chess program since 2017. At the time,
                I couldn't find any satisfactory guides to give to
                participants. This is one that I wrote myself which aims to
                cover all of the necessary knowledge without being too long
                or too short.
