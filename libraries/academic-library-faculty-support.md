*Here, I describe several key topics affecting academic libraries and how I
could assist faculty with them: data management plans, open access, and
intellectual property policy. This was originally written for my Academic
Libraries class in the Spring of 2018.*

Librarians in research institutions must offer support for teaching faculty,
and this service can manifest in a variety of ways. On this page, I examine
three particular areas in which I could serve university faculty as a
librarian: data management plans, open access, and intellectual property.

## Part 1: Research Data Management Plans

### Description and Key Issues

The importance of data has grown enormously in recent years, and most people
expect that trend to continue. While research literature always presents its
findings, it often does not publish the raw data itself. This can make
verifying and reproducing results difficult, time consuming, and expensive
for other researchers. When data is made available, it has the added effect
of making funding and public support more likely. While researchers tend to
shy away from creating formally data sharing policies, in practice, they
share their data liberally ([Keil, 2014][1]. Informal sharing and
preservation is often insecure and unaccountable. Emailing files or copying
them onto a thumb drive is not a safe or secure strategy, even if it is the
most convenient. But even without a license to share publicly, data must be
preserved in an accountable system. A data management plan (DMP) is valuable
for outlining exactly how this preservation and sharing will take place.

[1]: https://doi.org/10.1080/01930826.2014.915168

A DMP will specify how and where the data will be stored. It should explain
what software or equipment will be used, what file formats, and so on. It
will also specify where, or how, the data will be preserved. In addition to
the technical aspects of access, a DMP will also clarify licensing. The
researcher can grant access and usage rights to the public, retain rights for
themselves, an institution, or any other combination.

DMPs are not just a theoretical “best practice” anymore. Institutions and
funding agencies often require researchers to draft one before beginning a
project. For example, The National Science Foundation, the National
Institutes of Health, and the National Endowment for the Humanities require
data management plans for submissions ([Diekema, Wesolek & Walters 2014][2]).
Despite these requirements, Diekema et al. notes that most faculty are
unfamiliar with DMPs and are open to more help from their librarians.

[2]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2014.04.010

Academic librarians are natural leaders for DMPs. They have the most access
to, and usually are in-house experts on, repositories and licensing
information. Furthermore, they can more easily see the broad picture across
disciplines ([MacMillan, 2014][3]). A DMP can be structured like a legal
form, so it requires technical know-how to execute properly. There is no
one-size-fits-all solution. Librarians can aid researchers to follow best
practices and choose a plan that works with their needs. Despite this clear
opportunity for librarian partnerships, only a small number of academic
librarians are supporting data management ([Keil, 2014][4]), so this area has
room for expansion.

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of these lessons, faculty will be able to:

1. Explain what a DMP is.
2. Locate DMP resources.
3. Create a DMP.

### Learning Activities

**Activity 1: Create a DMP.** users would meet with a librarian and
walk-through how to create a DMP together with [DMPTool][5]. The users would
get to see the different templates offered by institutions on DMPTool and
what information they would be expected to provide.

[5]: https://dmptool.org/

The librarian would offer the users three research scenarios to base the DMPs
on:

1. A study of library fine policies, in which the researcher will collect the
   written policies from a number of public libraries and analyze them based on
   the amount they charge for overdue items.
2. A study of sleep habits, where participants will sleep in a laboratory
   with equipment that monitors their biometrics such as heart rate and REM
   time.
3. A study of plant photosynthesis, where the researcher will analyze several
   different types of trees and how much carbon dioxide they consume.

In each of these cases, the user will have to determine what data will have
to be collected, what format it should be stored in, if there would be any
sensitive or personal data, and anything else necessary to accurately fill
out their DMP.

**Activity 2: [Identifying Data Types and Stages of Data][6].** This comes
from Module 2 of **[New England Collaborative Data Management
Curriculum][7]**, which is a comprehensive series of learning modules, lesson
plans, and other DMP activities. This particular activity presents a sample
case study for researchers, and then asks them questions such as, “what file
types/formats might be involved in the study?” and, “for each of the items on
your data list, match it to one of the following data stages: Raw data,
Processed data, Analyzed data, Finalized/published data.”

### Tools

**[DMPTool][8]** is a free website that can generate unique DMPs tailored to a
researcher’s needs. It uses templates provided by institutions to guarantee
that each DMP meets required specifications.

[8]: https://dmptool.org/

**[Johns Hopkins University Data Management Services][9]** is a hub of tools
organized around the different needs of researchers at different points of
the research process. Although a lot of it points to resources for John
Hopkins University faculty, it also includes other information and links that
anyone can use.

[9]: http://dms.data.jhu.edu

**[Scholarly Communication Toolkit: Research Data Management][10]** is an ACRL
libguide containing a large and diverse amount of DMP resources. It’s a
definite go-to for users new to DMP.

## Part 2: Open Access & Institutional Repositories

### Description & Key Issues

Open access (OA) is when researchers publish literature in a format freely
available to anyone on the internet. It is partially a solution to the
so-called serials crisis, where libraries cannot afford the growing number of
expensive journals. For this, as well as other reasons, OA has risen in
popularity over the past several years.

There are two basic kinds of OA, green and gold. Gold OA is when a journal
itself publishes its content freely online. Green OA is when researchers
publish the literature themselves, usually by self-hosting or with an
institutional repository. When a non-OA journal publishes a work, it will
sometimes allow authors to publish their own green-OA version, but usually
only after an embargo period, or only a preprint copy.

Libraries are key to facilitating OA publications, because they typically
control the repositories which host the literature, and which journals their
discovery service can search. Wesolek ([2013][11]) says that most researchers
are fine with their work being open access, as long as it requires no
additional effort from them compared to a traditional publication. He
concludes that libraries should make OA publishing as easy as possible for
researchers. However, this does mean there will be an additional burden for
librarians.

[11]: https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.860856

Creating the technology for an OA repository is only the first step.
Librarians will have to advocate to get faculty on board, which means
adopting an OA policy for their institution. Kern & Wishnetsky ([2014][12])
discuss the differences in OA policies. The weakest form is an “encouragement
pledge,” which creates no obligation for faculty to publish OA. The strongest
type is called Harvard-style, because it resembles the one Harvard uses. It
mandates that faculty submit copies to the repository and gives the
institution permission to make the work publicly available. McKiel & Dooley
([2017][13]) also discuss the details of a Harvard-style, along with the
exact Harvard text.

[13]: https://doi.org/10.7771/2380-176X.6978

Wesolek ([2013][11]) notes that there is no “right” way to implement a
policy. It will all come down to the institutional culture and how much work
the librarians and faculty are willing to invest. However, successful
policies work effectively by educating faculty on OA, and making their
participation as easy as possible.

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of these lessons, faculty will be able to:

1. Explain what OA is.
2. How to recognize OA journal quality.
3. Understand our institution’s OA policy.

### Learning Activities

**Activity 1: [Open Access Quiz][14].** This online quiz was published by
Springer Nature, the academic publisher. It provides an introductory quiz on
basic OA concepts, such as "what are the two OA routes called?" and "what
does the CC BY license imply?" Users could do this quiz online on the
website.

[14]: https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/authorandreviewertutorials/open-access/quiz

**Activity 2: Concepts of Openness and Open Access Quiz.** These questions are
adapted from the quizzes in the "[Concepts of Openness and Open Access][15]"
module in [UNESCO’s Open Access Curriculum][16]. The curriculum itself is a
great source of learning tools for researchers or librarians looking for more
in-depth knowledge of publishing and the OA movement. This quiz would be
given in a classroom, accompanied by a face-to-face lecture that explains the
concepts.

### Tools

**[Unpaywall][18]** is a browser plugin that provides OA versions of non-OA
publications. When a user goes to a webpage containing a paywall for an
article, Unpaywall will search its database for an OA version and provide a
link to that instead.

[18]: http://unpaywall.org

**[Open Access and Scholarly Communications][19]** is a LibGuide that contains
a lot of information about OA, addressing a wide range of topics.

## Part 3: Intellectual Property

### Description & Key Issues

Copyright is a big business, and many universities are needing to adjust
their infrastructure to cover it. The topic is complex, nuanced, and
constantly changing in the courts. It’s usually dangerous to apply heuristic
or one-size-fits all policies to copyright issues. Because it’s a field that
requires expertise beyond that of most faculty, librarians are especially
poised to take on this issue.

Ferullo (2011) argues that it is necessary for universities to open copyright
offices, special departments with dedicated staff who are trained in
copyright issues. While the exact details of these copyright officers would
be left to the administration to decide, there are two main areas of
interest: author’s rights and mass digitization projects. Authors, the
faculty, are often encouraged to manage more and more of their copyright,
rather than just sign it away to a publisher. Many authors are too busy to be
interested in managing the legalities of their copyrights. This is where a
librarian in a copyright office would enter the picture.

Charbonneau & Priehs ([2014][20]) found that close to half of universities
have copyright centers or experts. However, Schmidt & English ([2015][21])
conclude that copyright instruction is not widespread enough, or in-depth
enough, to prepare librarians for the workplace. Copyright often intersects
with other library science topics, including the aforementioned DMP and OA
issues. Like these topics, librarians are obvious natural leaders in the
field. Copyright, as an area of academic librarian focus, is a field that is
ready for future expansion.

### Learning Outcomes

At the end of these lessons, faculty will be able to:

1. Know their rights as authors.
2. Understand the TEACH act (“Technology, Education and Copyright
   Harmonization Act”)
3. Know their institution’s copyright policies.

### Learning Activities

**Activity 1: [Copyright Quiz - Online Courses][22].** This quiz from Washburn
University covers copyright law as it applies to educators with distance
education classes. It's just five true-or-false questions, but the answers it
provides (by clicking "answers" at the bottom) are excellent references that
explain the topic. In particular, it clarifies details about the TEACH act.
Users could take this quiz online and then check their answers.

**Activity 2: Copyright policy quiz.** This is a quiz I would put together
based on the university's policy. I use [Colorado State University's copyright guidelines][23] for reference. This quiz would be presented face-to-face with a lecture to clarify the policy.

[23]: https://externalrelations.colostate.edu/copyright-guidelines/

1. If a student submits a paper, may a professor use portions of the paper
   for their own publication? (Answer: false)
2. Who owns copyright for works created by faculty employed by the university
   and using university resources? (Answer: the university)
3. Can faculty can always photocopy materials for their classes? (Answer:
   false)
4. Can faculty photocopy up to 10% of a work and in order to fall under fair
   use? (Answer: false)
5. The university does not allow photocopying "consumables" such as
   worksheets. (Answer: true)
6. Faculty may show a legally-purchased video during teaching activities.
   (Answer: true)
7. Who should faculty contact for clarifications about copyright? (Answer:
   the Copyright Clearance Center)
8. Faculty always have the right to copy their own publications. (Answer:
   false)

### Tools

**[Intellectual Property Policies for Universities][24]** is a searchable
database of policies across universities. Faculty can use this to locate
policies at their current institution, as well as review differences in other
institutions.
