*I worked with a team that researched the distribution of Hispanic and Latino
children's books in various US libraries, and we compared our findings with
population statistics to glean insights. This report is a summary of our
findings. This was originally written for my Introduction to Research in
Library and Information Science class in the Fall of 2017.*

## Summary of Results

The purpose of this study was to determine whether high-quality children’s
materials featuring Hispanic/Latino themes are available in U.S. public
libraries. The study examined both community and library variables to
determine the influences on the availability of these types of titles. The
results of this study indicate that the majority of U.S. public libraries
have at least half of these materials available. The library variables
studied were the location of the library and the number of librarians that
hold Masters in Library and Information Science (MLIS) degrees per library.
The community variable studied was the percentage of Hispanic people within
the population of the area where the library is located. This study found
that the library variables had a stronger correlation with the number of
titles held than the community variable.

One hundred four public libraries in the United States were analyzed to
determine how many titles their collection included from a list of 16
recently published Pura Belpré Award winners or honor books. Table 1 shows a
summary of the results of this analysis. The mean number of titles held by
each library is 10 of the 16 titles searched. Only 2% of the libraries held
all 16 titles and another 2% did not carry any of the titles. Seventy-one
percent of libraries had eight or more of the titles searched, while 29% had
seven or fewer. Each of the 16 titles was held by an average of 63 libraries.

The percentage of Hispanic residents in the county where the library is
located was examined to determine if there was a correlation between the
number of titles with Hispanic/Latino themes that each library holds and the
size of the Hispanic population. The libraries were divided into quartiles
consisting of 26 libraries each. The quartiles were analyzed to find the
average Hispanic population, the number of titles held by each quartile, and
the percentage of all titles held by each quartile. The data do not suggest a
strong correlation between Hispanic population and the number of titles held,
especially when compared to the other variables studied. Figure 1 summarizes
this data. Quartile 4 represents the libraries with the smallest Hispanic
population with an average of 1.84% of the library’s total population, while
Quartile 1 represents the libraries with the largest Hispanic population with
an average of 36.76%. Quartiles 2 and 3 have average Hispanic populations of
12.69% and 4.95%, respectively. The number of titles held by each quartile
ranges from 226 titles held by libraries in Quartile 4 to 281 titles in
Quartile 1. Quartiles 2 and 3 both hold 247 titles, despite a fairly large
difference in their average Hispanic populations. While Quartile 1 does hold
the highest average percentage of all titles and have the largest percentage
of Hispanic residents among the population of the libraries, the range of the
number of titles held is so narrow across the quartiles, despite the
differences in Hispanic population size, that a correlation between the two
variables appears nonexistent or negligible.

The next variable studied was the number of librarians in each library who
hold a postgraduate degree in Library Science. The libraries were once again
sorted into quartiles based on this data. The number of librarians with a
MLIS degrees was calculated for each quartile and then compared to the number
of titles held and the percentage of all titles held by that quartile. The
data are summarized in Figure 2. The data show a positive correlation between
the number of librarians holding MLIS degrees and the number of children’s
materials containing Hispanic/Latino themes. Quartile 1 represents the
libraries with the highest number of librarians holding MLIS degrees, at
18.54. This quartile holds 316 titles, representing 31.57% of all titles
held. Quartile 2 has the second highest number of librarians with MLIS
degrees at 10.23. This quartile holds 294 titles, or 29.37%. Quartile 3 has
an average of 5.06 librarians holding MLIS degrees and has 214 titles, or
21.38%. Only 1.42 librarians in Quartile 4 have MLIS degrees. This quartile
holds the lowest number of titles: 177, or 17.68%, of all titles. The number
of Pura Belpré titles held by the libraries in each quartile declines steeply
as the number of librarians holding Library Science degrees declines. The
consistency in the degree of decline for both variables indicates that there
is a positive correlation between libraries staffed by those with MLIS
degrees and the availability of books with strong Hispanic themes and
representation.

The libraries in the sample were sorted and grouped by one of four location
types: cities, suburban areas, towns, and rural areas. This resulted in
unequal groupings, with the majority of libraries being located in cities or
suburban areas. Ten libraries were located in rural areas, 21 in towns, 36 in
suburban areas, and 37 in cities. The groups were examined to determine the
total number of titles held in each group and the percentage of all titles
held. This data is summarized in Figure 3. Rural libraries hold the lowest
percentage of the titles at 5.29%. Towns hold the second lowest percentage of
the titles at 18.68%. Suburban libraries hold 37.56% of the titles. Cities
hold the highest number of titles with 38.46%. The data suggest that cities
and suburbs are much more likely to carry children’s literature with Hispanic
and Latino themes than towns and rural areas. These figures are somewhat
misleading, however, due to the higher number of city and suburban libraries
in the sample. The average number of titles held by each library within each
group was also calculated in an effort to compensate for the unequal
groupings. The percentage of all titles held was recalculated using these
averages. The results of these adjustments are summarized in Figure 4. While
rural and town libraries still had fewer holdings, the differences were
significantly less, with an average of 15.12% of the titles held per library
in rural areas and 25.4% in towns. Suburban libraries had an average of
29.79% of all titles per library and libraries within cities had an average
of 29.68%.

## Limitations

There were several limitations with this study. The study relied on data
gathered from the online library catalogs. Availability within the catalog
does not guarantee that the material will be found within the library.
Likewise, only items that each library had within their collections were
counted. However, many of the libraries were part of a consortium and could
provide the materials to patrons even though they might not hold copies in
their own collections. In addition, the number of titles searched were
limited to only 16 titles. A more extensive search for Hispanic-themed
materials may provide a complete picture of the materials available to
Hispanic patrons. The study was also limited to the availability of books and
neglected to examine other types of materials or services that may serve the
needs of this population. Finally, when the libraries in this study were
sorted by locale, the resulting groups contained unequal numbers. While the
data was manipulated in an attempt to compensate for this, equal groups of
libraries by locale could produce more reliable data.

## Conclusions

There are several conclusions that can be drawn from this study. First, the
size of the Hispanic population of an area does not appear to correlate with
the number of Pura Belpré Award and honoree books a library holds. This is
surprising, given the well-known adage that demand should inform supply,
therefore it does not seem unreasonable to assume that the demands of large
Hispanic populations would result in a library with a large supply of
Hispanic and Latino children’s literature. One of the factors that might be
affecting this result is the small list of specific titles. Only 16 titles
were chosen, all of recent publication and recognized by the same award. A
more comprehensive search of Hispanic/Latino themed materials, as well as
Spanish language materials, could potentially reveal very different results.
Future researchers could conduct a more thorough search of these kinds of
materials, and may even want to extend their research beyond books to library
programs and services aimed at the Hispanic population, in order to determine
whether the needs of this population are being met. Any materials and
services specifically intended to serve the Hispanic and Latino population
could be evaluated for quality in an effort to guarantee that libraries are
providing for Hispanic patrons’ needs. Libraries with higher Hispanic
populations should make a concentrated effort to regularly add high-quality
materials featuring Hispanic/Latino themes to their collections.

The second conclusion drawn from this data is that the number of librarians
that hold Master’s degrees in Library Science has a positive correlation with
the number of Hispanic/Latino themed materials held by the library. One
possible explanation for this is that librarians that hold MLIS degrees are
more likely to develop collections that represent a variety of cultural
viewpoints. The results of this study suggest that public libraries
interested in expanding the diversity of their collections and providing for
the needs of diverse patrons should invest in hiring MLIS-credentialed
librarians.

Third, the data show a positive correlation between public libraries located
in more highly populated areas and the number of materials with
Hispanic/Latino themes in the collection. One possible explanation for this
is that more financial resources are available to libraries in more highly
populated areas, and this funding could be used both to expand the collection
and to hire librarians with degrees who may suggest or direct any
collection-expansion efforts. Future research could examine annual
collections budgets to determine if there is a correlation between the budget
numbers and number of Hispanic/Latino titles held. In an effort to better
meet the needs of Hispanic patrons, libraries with limited materials should
take advantage of grants that would help include needed titles to represent
Hispanic/Latino themes. Another explanation is that there is simply more
demand for these materials in more densely-populated areas. An examination of
census records could be used to determine how density of population
correlates to ethnic and cultural diversity, and thus in turn how the
population density of an area correlates to the need for diverse library
materials.

This study has shown positive correlations between both population density
and number of MLIS-degree librarians, and the number of high-quality books
with Hispanic and Latino themes held by each library, and has revealed little
or no correlation between a high percentage of Hispanic patrons and the
number of Hispanic-themed books in the library. This study did not include
research into several factors that could affect these results, but the data
are sound and it is believed these results are accurate and repeatable within
the frame of the study.
