<p>Contextual Feed Widget (and I’m open to suggestions for a better name) is a Wordpress plugin that displays a list of feed links that are appropriate for the page that’s currently open. For example, you’ll see a link to a category feed when viewing a category. I developed it for johnridesa.bike, and you can see it active on almost every page here (<a href="#contextual_feed_widget-3">including this page</a>).</p>

<p>It’s a simple plugin and I doubt anyone will have much of a problem using it. If you do have any issues or feature suggestions, <a href="https://github.com/johnridesabike/Contextual-Feed-Widget">you can browse the code or submit an issue on the GitHub repository</a>, which is where I do most of my development.&nbsp;</p>
