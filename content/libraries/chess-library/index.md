In 2017, I began an adult chess library program for [Chattahoochee Valley Libraries](http://www.cvlga.org/) in Columbus, Georgia. It’s been a hit with our community and continues to grow. I believe that its success comes from the way chess transcends the gaps between diverse people.

In 2019, we hosted our first open tournament.

I wasn’t satisfied with any of of the existing rule handouts I could find, so I wrote my own. [You can read the online version of the handout here](/libraries/how-play-chess/). Feel free to copy and adapt it for your own programs.
