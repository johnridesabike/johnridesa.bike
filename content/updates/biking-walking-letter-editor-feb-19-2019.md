[The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer published a letter of mine](https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article226272120.html) which discusses the state of biking and walking in downtown Columbus. You can read the full letter on their site, but here’s an excerpt:

> I’d like to ask the people downtown what it would take to get them to walk a block instead of drive. […] Meanwhile, no one seems to complain about having to walk across a Walmart parking lot to do their shopping, which can stretch even longer than a city block.
