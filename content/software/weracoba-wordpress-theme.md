Weracoba is my custom-built theme based on [Underscores](https://underscores.me/). Until I switched away from WordPress, I used it to power the site here on [johnridesa.bike](https://johnridesa.bike/).

<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter download"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://github.com/johnridesabike/Weracoba">Download or Fork Weracoba</a></div>

A few key ideas guide its design: minimal use of widgets, major use of categories, and a focus on reading content. Since I keep more than just typical "blog" content on my website, this theme helps organize the different categories.

## Use and contributing

Although I use Weracoba, it's not quite ready for public distribution. It lacks several features like customizer options that a WordPress administrator will probably need. But feel free to use it, if you dare. Weracoba is GPL 2.0 licensed, so go ahead and browse the source or copy the code for your own theme. [Pull requests, issue submissions](https://github.com/johnridesabike/Weracoba), and [emails](mailto:jbpjackson@icloud.com) are always welcome.

## Notes on using Weracoba

There are three widget areas: A sidebar that appears beside posts, a sidebar that appears beside the blog index and archive, and the footer. 

Weracoba has some special styling for Gutenberg blocks. I only styled the ones I’m actively using, so it’s not feature-complete.
