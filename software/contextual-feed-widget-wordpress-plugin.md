My “Contextual Feed Widget” plugin is now live on the WordPress Plugin Directory. Now you can easily add it to your own website.

Contextual Feed Widget (and I’m open to suggestions for a better name) is a Wordpress plugin that displays a list of feed links that are appropriate for the page that’s currently open. For example, you’ll see a link to a category feed when viewing a category. I developed it for johnridesa.bike, and you can see it active on almost every page here (<a href="#contextual_feed_widget-3">including this page</a>).

It’s a simple plugin and I doubt anyone will have much of a problem using it. If you do have any issues or feature suggestions, [you can browse the code or submit an issue on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnridesabike/Contextual-Feed-Widget), which is where I do most of my development.
