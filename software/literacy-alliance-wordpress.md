The Literacy Alliance is a nonprofit organization dedicated to literacy
education in Columbus, Georgia. Beginning in 2017, I redesigned their
website, [theliteracyalliance.org], from the ground up with WordPress.

[theliteracyalliance.org]: https://theliteracyalliance.org/

The new website highlights their current impact, their history, and
streamlines the ability of users to volunteer, donate, or find educational
resources. It's designed with modern web technologies, for users on desktop
or mobile browsers.
