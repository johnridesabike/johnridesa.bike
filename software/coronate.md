## üßê About

I began working on Coronate shortly after hosting a tournament as a public
library program. I discovered a dearth of free software, so I and decided to
change that. Library employees deal with limited budgets and restrictive
computer access, so purchasing, installing, and learning to use specialized
tournament software is usually a considerable barrier-to-entry.

Coronate aims to solve this problem. It‚Äôs free, open source, and runs on
almost any system. Although it (probably) won‚Äôt replace a professional app in
a rated tournament, it fills the gap for small clubs or public events.

Coronate is in a "proof-of-concept" phase. [If you would like to contribute
your feature ideas, just file an issue!][issues]

## ‚ôü How to use it

Coronate tournaments use the Swiss-style system. For the unfamiliar, [my
article on running your first chess tournament][2] can explain how the
logistics work. While understanding those is helpful, Coronate should
effortlessly manage the nitty-gritty for you.

### Rounds

After you make a tournament and add your players, you can create a new round.
There is a basic interface to help you pair players, but you should almost
always use the ‚Äúauto-pair players‚Äù button. Typically, just resort to manual
pairing if the auto-pair results cause a problem.

Once the players are paired, the pairings will be listed in a numbered order.
These numbers would typically correspond to specific tables or chess sets you
have. The round screen provides controls to rearrange these pairings, swap
players‚Äô colors, or unpair the players. Of course, you can also set the
result of each match.

Once each match has been completed, you can begin pairing the next round.

You can add or remove players from your tournament at any time (such as late
entries or players who have left).

### Other tournament pages

Besides the rounds, there are a few other pages for each tournament:

- **Tournament status** displays the current standings alongside the most
  recent round‚Äôs matches. This serves as a quick overview of the most
  pertinent information, something to display in the background while the
  tournament is in progress.
- **Crosstable** displays a table showing every player‚Äôs results with every
  other player, along with their rating gain or loss.
- **Score detail** displays exactly how the standings are calculated: which
  tiebreak methods are used, what order they‚Äôre in, and what the result of
  each scoring method is for each player.

### Players

Outside of tournaments, there is also a page for managing players. If you
open a player profile, you can specify which other players they should
*never* be paired with. For example, you can use this to prevent matches
between family members.

**Ratings** are calculated after each match and saved to each player‚Äôs
profile. This uses a very basic rating algorithm, and isn‚Äôt predictive of a
USCF or FIDE rating.

You can edit other player data as well, but you typically won‚Äôt need to.

## üóÉ Managing tournament data

Unlike most web apps, Coronate doesn‚Äôt keep your data in ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù (e.g.
someone else‚Äôs computer). Instead, your data is saved to your browser‚Äôs
storage. This mostly works well, but it comes with caveats: a) moving data
from one device to another is frustrating, b) backing up and making copies of
data is frustrating, and c) browsers manage their data differently from each
other and are sometimes eager to quietly delete or restrict storage.

You can manually load and save your data through its ‚Äúoptions‚Äù screen. If you
create a tournament on your work laptop and want to ensure its records are
preserved, just go to the options and save the file somewhere safe. At any
point, you can open Coronate again and load the data.

## ü•∞ Enjoy using Coronate?

Coronate is free software, but you're welcome to show your appreciation.

## üåÖ The future

Coronate is currently 1.0 status, mostly bug-free and with all of the basic
functionality. There are still plenty of features that can go into the next
version, but I haven't decided yet what to focus on.

One common suggestion has been to make it compatible with other games that
use Swiss-style tournament structures. If you have a specific game that you
would like to see it support, just let me know.

## ü§ì Behind the scenes

### Scoring

I modeled the scorekeeping code after the specifications by the USCF. When
appropriate, the code should have comments indicating the specific section of
the rulebook they come from. Not all scoring rules are implemented (yet),
just the commonly used ones.

[USCF‚Äôs scoring guidelines can be found on their rulebook, which is freely
downloadable here.](http://www.uschess.org/content/view/7752/369/)

### Pairing

Similar to scoring, the auto-pairing functions aim to comply with USCF
recommendations. Pairing is a much trickier beast than scoring, however. The
current implementation is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù for now, and still needs more work.

### Source code

Coronate is written with [ReScript] and [React]. All code is [AGPL v3.0
licensed][license] which allows anyone to download and modify it. I welcome
contributions in code, as well as suggestions and bug reports. [Visit the
repository page to get started][repo].
